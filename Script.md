## Plot

Max woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egge he left for school.
Normally Max would have walked down Bleaker streat, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Max’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he mooved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick floiage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Max had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

The zookeeper, Braus, must've forgotten to close this door, thought max. How silly of him, He should be more careful.

Normally Max would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Max met the Unicorn King who granted him magic powers to use to fight the good. The Unicorn King needed a new soldier, and while he was looking a young boy fell into his lap. His plan for world domination is one step ever closer.

Mike, the guardian Koala, was watching from the distance. Dissapointed that his plan to stop the unicorn king has been made more difficult. He dreams of his epic fight with Max, the Unicorn King's new champion.  
The end.
